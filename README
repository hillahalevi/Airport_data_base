Hi there :)
I want to explain a bit about how my data base works 
I have 5 base tables each starts with a specific id :
# Plane       "pTable" : id,model_number,crew_needed,max_capacity_first_class,max_capacity_second_class
# Flight      "fTable" : id,model_number,Date,source,destination
# Customer    "cTable" : id,full_name,priority_number
# Emplolyee   "eTable" : id,Job_title,seniority,birth_year,employer_id
# Reservation "rTable" : id,customer_id,flight_id,class_wanted,max_baggage

In addition I have  5 sub tables:

#  F_E_FILE_NAME "feTable" :employee_id, flight_id
#  P_D_FILE_NAME "pdTable" :date_reserved, plane_id
#  D_E_FILE_NAME "deTable" :date_reserved, employee_id
#  MAX_F_FLIGHT "mxfirstfTable" :max_capacity_first, flight_id
#  MAX_E_FLIGHT "mxeconomyfTable" :max_capacity_second, flight id 

this sub tables help me in the tasks of assigning a plane and a crew and check if my flight is available
if I want to schedule a flight  I need to assign a plane and a crew:
for that I will check my planes table for planes of that model then with P_D i will see if one of then is available in our date.
again with the crew i will take from my plane table the info about the crew needed and get all of this employies and the check my D_E if their avaliable in my date.
if I mannaged to assign crew and a plane I will update my tables "P_D D_E and F_E so when I will need to get a flight using its id I can restore its assigned crew. 

if I want to add a reservation i will check my flight table if this flight exict again with the customer id then i will pull out all the reservation for this flight
count all those with my class type and check my max capaxity table if theres room for one more.

so thank you for your time - hope you have a great life!
